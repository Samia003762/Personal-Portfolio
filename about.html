<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I’m an ambitious, detail-oriented gap-year student aiming for a degree apprenticeship in the tech industry. My studies in Computer Science and additional, extra-curricular courses have given me a strong, practical foundation in problem solving and data-focused thinking. I like to build my knowledge and skills through personal development, on subjects that interest me as I will be able to enjoy while I learn. Working within teams has always been instilled in me, from family life to school life to work life, as for everything to run smoothly there has to be collaboration and communication between people. </p>


<h3>What I enjoy</h3>
<p>I’m someone who learns quickly, especially through hands-on tasks. Whether it’s building full-stack projects or exploring new platforms like ServiceNow during work experience, I enjoy understanding how systems work and how they can be improved. Once I understand a topic I like to put it into practice and help others understand it too, if it's something that I can teach.</p>


<h3>Work & experience</h3>
<p>Across all my roles I have done in different industries and environments, I’ve learnt many different skills. This is something I appreciate as it has helped me within various aspects of life, for example communicating with strangers, having responsibility over others and myself and building time-management skills. In my retail roles I really grew as a person, throughout my time I had to maintain customer focus but at the same time grasp how to get things done with the people around me. In my technical work experiences I learnt the value of a network and the different structures in a corporate setting, allowing me to be prepared for my career. I was able to speak to seasoned professionals and gained valuable advice that I still adhere to now. Being around groups of people near my age and with similar goals, I could benefit from their motivation and create spaces where we could share ideas and information. Having a lot of these experiences all in a short timeframe really kept me busy and helped me actively reach my goals and keep developing as a person. </p>


<h3>How I work</h3>
<p>During my work experience at UP3, I was told that all their employees took a personality test where they get colours and descriptions based on their answers. I completed the quiz and got Earth Green (37%), Cool Blue (26%), Sunshine Yellow (21%) and Fiery Red (16%). After reading the summary I understood why I got those results as it really reflected my personality. The main adjectives that came up were structured, analytical, cooperative, cheerful and purposeful. I enjoy taking different personality tests as I can see objectively how I am and how others might view me; I took the MBTI test a couple times and either got ISTJ or ISFJ, ISTJ is the Logistician who are known for being dependable, responsible, and logical, and they thrive in structured environments with clear goals. ISFJ’s are practical, detail-oriented, and committed to serving others, often preferring structure and traditional values. This sums up how I usually work including the fact that I enjoy both working with people and alone as there are merits of both. </p>


<h3>My strengths and weaknesses</h3>
<p>I believe my strengths are my patience and ability to manage myself in all aspects, which come from both my familial life and outside activities. Being the youngest of 5 with a minimum 6 year age gap and maximum 13, I matured quite young as I learnt a lot from my siblings. I am also keen on constant improvement so I am able to learn and adapt quickly whether it’s technical or general skills. Prioritising my tasks has also been something I’ve been doing since my A Levels, so I could balance my studies, work and other things I had to get done. My main weakness is presenting and difficulty saying no, which mostly can be improved with confidence and the degree to which I know the other person. Once I am comfortable with the person I will be more likely to present my ideas and say no. In both my Valcon placement and UP3 I had to present to a group of people, which helped me face my difficulties and also get tips on how to improve.  </p>
