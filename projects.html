<article class="project">
    <h3>Cinema Booking System</h3>
    <p>This is a full-stack web application built using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It includes both a customer and admin side, with features such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User registration and login with hashed passwords</li>
        <li>Movie listings and dynamically loaded showtimes</li>
        <li>Interactive seat selection using JavaScript and PHP</li>
        <li>Full relational database: users, movies, showtimes, seats, bookings, booking_seats</li>
        <li>Admin dashboard to add movies, manage showtimes and edit seat layouts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This project taught me how to restructure a system after recognising limitations. I started with a Python Tkinter idea, then rebuilt the entire project in PHP after realising the advantages of web-based systems. I also strengthened my debugging skills when fixing SQL syntax issues and designed the interactive seat map independently.</p>

    <h3>Static Spotify Artist Analysis</h3>
    <p>I wanted to create a program that analysed a user's Spotify listening history, but API authentication made it challenging to use dynamic data. Instead, I adapted the idea and built a program that visualised data about a chosen artist using a static dataset. This helped me learn:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data cleaning and preparation</li>
        <li>Creating charts and graphs</li>
        <li>Working around API limitations</li>
    </ul>

<article class="project">
    <h3>Role Playing Game</h3>
    <p>I created this game to practice my OOP skills and widen my portfolio. This gave me practical experience for my exams and gave me creative freedom to do what I want, which was really fun. Seeing how games start without a user interface made me interested in how huge games like Minecraft and League of Legends started and how much code they wrote. </p>

<article class="project">
    <h3>School Group Project</h3>
    <p>In this group project, I was responsible for the SQL and database design. I helped connect everyone’s work, debugged errors, and ensured data was being stored correctly. We finished first in our class and was praised for our communication and collaboration</p>

<article class="project">
    <h3>Personality Quiz</h3>
    <p>I wanted to make my own version of a personality quiz, so I did some research and used tkinter that I was already familiar with for the interface. It determines your personality type based on 10 questions which were as simple as I wanted to make it, so I could debug it easier and actually complete it. </p>
